# Gabriel's Toolbox 
## What is this?
Think of this as your coding Swiss Army knife. Gabe's Python Toolbox is a collection code snippets—perfect for those "I swear I've written this before" moments. It's not a specialized library for one thing; it's a general-purpose grab-n-go bag for useful, reusable boilerplate code.

If you're tired of writing the same functions over and over, this might save you a few headaches (and keystrokes).

## Setup Guide
in terminal for project 

'''
py -m pip install git+https://github.com/VikingInOrbit/GabesPythonToolBox.git
'''

Import what you need, when you need it. 
using "import GabesPythonToolBox as GTB" for all
or import "GabesPythonToolBox.Category.lib as (XX)"
That’s it. You're good to go.
